      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Esther and I am 20 years old. I am a third-year Systems
        Engineering student at the University of Lagos. I am Nigerian and I hail
        from Ogun state in Nigeria. I am 175cm tall.

        Frontend Engineering has always been a topic I have been curious about
        for the longest time but I have not really had the opportunity or time
        to learn it. From a young age, I have been fascinated by technology and
        how it can solve complex problems. The rapidly changing world of
        engineering, especially in fields like software development, artificial
        intelligence and data science, deeply excites me. Altschool's focus on a
        curriculum designed to foster real-world skills aligns perfectly with my
        passion and career aspirations. Also, AltSchool's hands-on learning
        model is exactly what I was looking for. The opportunity to apply
        theoretical knowledge through hands-on projects will help me build
        practical skills and experience that I can use in my future career. I
        was drawn to AltSchool's unique approach to personalised learning. The
        ability to work at my own pace, receive tailored support from mentors,
        and focus on areas that interest me most is an important factor in my
        decision. this method eables me to stay motivated and engaged, ensuring
        that I can meet my educational goals in a way that suits my learning
        style.

        My goals for School of Engineering program is that by the end of these
        12 months, I would acquire a deep understanding of Frontend Engineering
        and develop the technical skills required to solve real-world problems.
        I also want to leverage AltSchool's project-based learning approach to
        gain practical, hands-on experience in building and designing webpages
        and the likes. I believe that this method will help me meet up in this
        fast-evolving tech industry. Another one of my goals is to connect with
        other passionate and like-minded individuals. I am excited to
        collaborate with my peers, share ideas, and learn from others'
        perspectives to broaden my knowledge and approach to engineering. In
        addition to the technical expertise, I hope to develop essential soft
        skills like teamwork, communication, and time management. These skills
        will enable me to to effectively collaborate in diverse, professional
        settings and enhance my ability to lead and manage frontend engineering
        in the future.
